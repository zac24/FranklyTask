===========
Created an App.net client that just lists the most recent posts from the public timeline.

 - Each post rendered in a table view cell, with the most recent at the top.  
 - Each cell contains the user's avatar (Corners are rounded).
 - Each cell contains the poster's name in bold
 - Each cell contains the post text, and are of variable height, depending on the text size
 - Pull to refresh has been implemented to refresh the timeline
 - The list scrolls quickly, without dropping frames on an iPhone 5.
